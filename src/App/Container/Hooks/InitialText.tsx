## Profile
👋 Hello there! My name is Jorge Holguin, and I am a passionate Electronics Engineer with a knack for programming. Additionally, I manage an exciting YouTube channel focused on web development and artificial intelligence. Check it out here! 🎥 [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vidadigital1994)

💡 My goal is to become a Senior Full Stack Developer and keep continuously learning about the ever-evolving tech world. Technology is my passion, and I always seek new ways to contribute to the digital realm. 🌐📚

💪 When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me staying active and healthy through exercise and riding my electric unicycle. It's an excellent way to release energy and have fun! 🏋️‍♂️🚴‍♂️

🎮 Apart from my love for technology, I have a soft spot for video games, where I can unwind and enjoy myself. 🎮😄

🎯 2024 Goals:
- 🚀 Mastering in-depth Web Development skills 🎨 while also exploring the world of Backend 🚪.
- 📚 Keep learning and engaging with the tech community because there's always something new to discover and share. 🤓🌟
- 🌍 Contribute to building incredible open-source projects 🏛️, leaving a positive impact on the tech community and beyond.

⚙️ Currently, I'm well-versed in various technologies and tools, such as: Git, MySQL, Python, Java, Linux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, C#, Express.js, TypeScript, among others.

🐧 In my free time, I love experimenting with Linux operating systems and documenting my learning on Notion. It's an excellent way to try out new things and learn! ✨

🌱 Currently, I'm studying the Google Cloud Engineer Learning Path. Exciting times lie ahead! ☁️

If you have any questions or need assistance with anything, feel free to ask. I'm always interested in helping and sharing knowledge. Let's stay connected! 🗨️
